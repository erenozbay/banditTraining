# Bandit Labor Training

Experiments from https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06853v4 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06853 live here.

Extra sets of experiments as well: the dynamic market simulation and some rotting bandit (due to Seznec et al. "Rotting bandits are no harder than stochastic ones." AISTATS, 2019) implementations.
